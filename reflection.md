## Reflection

### What went well?

- We communicated well as a team in terms of keeping each other in the loop of what each other was working on and the overall progress of the development. Everyone felt like they are a part of the team.

- We were able to make the charts according to our original plan. Dash callbacks and Ggplotly interaction features allowed us to create interactive graphs based on our vision. The end product feels complete.

- With active and consensus-driven cooperation, each team member was able to do what they wanted and not get assigned to uninteresting tasks to ensure that the project was fun and enjoyable for everyone.

- Our final product does an excellent job of allowing users to look at the gender balance trends from different angles. They can investigate a single job's gender proportion, compare job gender dominant groups' popularities, and explore the female employment numbers for the top 10 positions in some of those groups. Basically, the application allows a variety of ways to gain insights on how the gender balance has been changing, and hence enable users to ask better questions on how to improve gender ratios in some industries.

### Limitations

- We still had limited knowledge about the full extent of Dash's and Ggplotly's capability for interactive graphs. We could not rule out the possibilities of more efficacious graphs that allow users to drill down to more valuable insights.    

- The user experience was not exactly optimal because we all lacked the expertise of application design. Our dashboard interface could be more aesthetically pleasing, more fun to spend time on, and more intuitive to use if we had more UX and UI expertise on the team.

- We were not able to identify the source of the data and get more background information on it. We do not know whether the data was for a country or several countries. We do not know how the data was collected either. Having this information would be to help design the charts.

- Our dataset contains information until the year 2000, which is not up_to_date. We wish to have some more information about the last two decades, so our app would be more effective.

### Future improvements

- There are lots of room for improvement in making the app more aesthetically pleasing and more intuitive in terms of user experience. For instance, the charts can probably be laid out better to allow users to compare them. The text elements can be reorganized so that they convey the relevance of the information better. The input elements can take up less space so that they are more obstructive to the entire experience but serve their functions at the same time.

- We can group the jobs into industries and develop more useful charts regarding the gender balance in different sectors. Users who are looking for insights about the historical trends of industry gender ratios would undoubtedly appreciate these additional charts.

### Addressed issues

We solved a bunch of issues for this milestone. We picked a mechanic as a team on how to choose the top 10 jobs in terms of gender balance. Our axes were made not to change anymore after our TA gave us feedback. We made the menu panel more clear and added more information about the data based on the TA's feedback. We updated the axes of the plot which were of the scientific notation format by default. It was previously hard to read for a non-scientific audience. Also, we added more information about the source of the data and how the gender balance groups were derived to address that ambiguity raised by the TA.
